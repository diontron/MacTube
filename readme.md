MacTube is a webview wrapper for YouTube for Mac OS. 

It was made for people who prefer Safari and don't want to have to open Chrome just to launch their official web app.

## Malicious Software Warning

When you try and open MacTube for the first time, you will get this error:

> “MacTube” can’t be opened because Apple cannot check it for malicious software.

Just click `OK`, then go to `Settings -> Security & Privacy`, and click the `Open Anyway` button.

This app does not contain a virus or anything sketchy, it's just what Apple does for developers who have not registered with them.

## Contributing

This app was created with SwiftUI.

It is super simple right now, but more features may be added in the future.

If you would like to add a feature, please feel free to submit a PR.
